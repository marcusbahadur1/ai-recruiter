# TODO — AI Recruiter (airecruiterz.com)
Last updated: 2026-04-26 (session 26)

## 🔴 Now (current sprint / active work)

All Now items complete — see ✅ Done below.

## 🟡 Next (queued and ready)

All Now items complete — see ✅ Done below.

## 🔵 Local Testing (pre-deployment gate)
- ✅ Verify IMAP poller picks up a test email and creates an application record
- ✅ Run `npm run smoke` locally against running app (`e2e/`) — 47/47 passing

## 🟣 Staging Deployment

- ✅ Create staging Supabase project — apply schema via Alembic migrations, enable pgvector + RLS
- ✅ Seed staging DB with anonymised copy of production data (`pg_dump --data-only` with PII scrubbed)
- ✅ Create Railway staging environment — deploy FastAPI + Celery worker + Redis from `main` branch
- ✅ Create Vercel staging environment — point at staging Railway API + staging Supabase
- ✅ Configure staging Stripe webhook endpoint → staging Railway URL
- ✅ Add GitHub secrets: `STAGING_URL`, `STAGING_API_URL`, `STAGING_TEST_EMAIL`, `STAGING_TEST_PASSWORD`
- ✅ Set remaining staging env vars — `SENDGRID_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `SCRAPINGDOG_API_KEY`, `BRIGHTDATA_API_KEY`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `FRONTEND_URL`, `ENVIRONMENT` all confirmed set on Railway (api + worker)
- ✅ Run `npm ci && npx playwright install` in `e2e/` to generate `package-lock.json` for CI cache — already committed in session 15
- ✅ Trigger `staging-smoke.yml` manually — 47/47 smoke tests passing against staging
- ✅ Manually sign off staging — all features confirmed working

## 🟠 Production Deployment

- ✅ Create production Supabase project (Sydney, ap-southeast-2) — 11 tables, migration v0012, pgvector enabled
- ✅ Enable RLS on all 10 tables — migration 0013 applied to staging + production; verified via pg_class query
- ⏸ Enable Supabase point-in-time recovery + daily backups — deferred until first paying customer (requires Pro plan)
- ✅ Create Railway production environment — promoted staging env to production; Supabase swapped to Sydney project; ENVIRONMENT=production; EMAIL_TEST_MODE removed; auto-deploys from `main`
- ✅ Create Vercel production environment — `app.airecruiterz.com` live with HTTPS; production Supabase env vars set; `FRONTEND_URL` updated on Railway
- ✅ Configure Stripe production webhook + 3 plan products/prices (Recruiter $499, Agency Small $999, Agency Medium $2,999 AUD/mo); live keys set on Railway + Vercel
- ✅ Configure shared IMAP mail server — `privateemail.com:993` carried over from staging, already set on Railway
- ✅ Set all production env vars — all variables confirmed present on Railway (api + worker)
- ✅ Verify DB connected — `/health` confirmed `"db":"ok"`
- ✅ Signup working end-to-end — 201 response through Vercel proxy confirmed
- ✅ Remove `pwd_hint` and `host` diagnostic fields from `/health` response
- ✅ Railway health check configured — pings `/health` every 30s, auto-restarts on failure (`backend/railway.toml`)
- ✅ Uptime alerting — set up UptimeRobot monitors for Railway API + app.airecruiterz.com (manual step, see instructions)
- ✅ Fix critical production 500 bug — `AsyncSessionLocal` missing import in `main.py`
- ✅ Chat send working on production with SSE streaming restored — single `▋` cursor while waiting
- ✅ Fix `DuplicatePreparedStatementError` — switched main SQLAlchemy engine to `NullPool` in `backend/app/database.py`; eliminates prepared statement conflicts in pgbouncer transaction mode
- ✅ Fix chat history loss between turns — streaming persist now uses explicit UPDATE via fresh `AsyncSessionLocal` (NullPool + FastAPI dependency lifecycle made ORM commit unreliable after async yields); frontend `hydratedRef` prevents React Query re-fetch from overwriting `sessionId` mid-conversation (`backend/app/routers/chat_sessions.py`, `frontend/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/chat/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Fix signup error message — human-readable message when email already exists instead of raw JSON (`backend/app/routers/auth.py`)
- ✅ Fix super admin nav not appearing — replaced `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL` env var check with backend API probe (`frontend/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`); confirmed Email Test Mode toggle working in production
- ✅ Vercel deploy process confirmed — GitHub auto-deploy unreliable; use `~/.local/bin/vercel --prod --scope marcusbahadur1s-projects` from `frontend/` directory
- Resume and complete smoke test on production: post job via AI chat → verify full pipeline

## ⚪ Deferred / Parked

- GDPR checklist: DPA prompt on first login, unsubscribe link in outreach emails, GDPR delete functional — deferred until EU market launch
- Post-recruitment interview scheduling via AI chat (§6.5) — requires calendar integration not yet specced
- EU data residency enforcement (separate Supabase region for EU tenants) — infrastructure decision needed
- Enterprise plan onboarding SLA + custom onboarding flow — waiting on enterprise customer
- Upgrade competency test examiner to OpenAI Assistants API — persistent thread per test session, better conversational memory, cleaner back-and-forth probing (`backend/app/routers/applications.py` + `backend/app/tasks/screener_tasks.py`)

## ✅ Done

- Railway worker healthcheck fix — removed `healthcheckPath`/`healthcheckTimeout` from `backend/railway.toml`; set healthcheck directly on api service via Railway GraphQL API; worker now deploys `SUCCESS` on every GitHub push (was failing since April 22nd)

- Email Test Mode toggle in super admin UI — `platform_settings.py` service stores state in Redis (`platform:email_test_mode`, `platform:email_test_recipient`); `GET/POST /super-admin/email-test-mode` endpoints; toggle card + persistent amber warning banner in super admin page; Celery worker reads from Redis at task runtime so no restart needed; env var `EMAIL_TEST_MODE` retained as cold-start fallback

- RLS security fix — migration `0013` enables `ROW LEVEL SECURITY` + `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` on all 10 tables; resolves Supabase `rls_disabled_in_public` + `sensitive_columns_exposed` alerts; verified on staging and production
- Fixed `migrations/env.py` — was hardcoded to `DATABASE_URL`; now reads `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL` + `DB_PASSWORD` matching `database.py` pattern; `alembic upgrade head` now works locally
- Environment files — `backend/.env-staging` and `backend/.env-production` created with all keys sourced from Railway; gitignored (GitHub push protection blocks plaintext secrets); `.env.example` updated as full variable reference

- AI chat streaming — `POST /chat-sessions/{id}/message/stream` SSE endpoint; tokens stream from Claude in real time; message field extracted from JSON mid-stream; all messages go to AI
- AI chat welcome message renders instantly on page load (removed isLoading gate)
- Diagnosed Railway UptimeRobot downtime as deploy-triggered restart — not a persistent issue
- Frontend smoke test: full walkthrough complete — signup, email confirmation, post job via AI chat, jobs, candidates, applications, settings, billing all working correctly
- SSE streams verified: Evaluation Report + Audit Trail both show live activity on `/jobs/{id}`
- Supabase email confirmation enabled; custom SMTP via SendGrid configured (sender: marcus.bahadur@aiworkerz.com); confirmation email template updated to AIRecruiterz branding
- Backend smoke test: Swagger UI loads at `http://localhost:8000/docs`, all 19 routers registered
- Verified all `scheduled_tasks.py` beat tasks fully implemented: `send_daily_summaries`, `cleanup_expired_tokens`, `sync_stripe_plans`, `rag_refresh`, `process_expired_trials`

- Playwright E2E test: recruiter posts job via AI chat → verify job created in DB (`e2e/tests/01-job-via-chat.spec.ts`)
- Playwright E2E test: candidate completes competency test → `test_status` updated (`e2e/tests/02-competency-test.spec.ts`)

- Fixed all 52 failing tests — 294 unit + integration tests, 0 failures (`backend/tests/`)
- Fixed Alembic migration `fd821988c15c` — `tenants.user_id` was never added on fresh installs; rewrote migration properly
- Fixed `super_admin.py` `TenantAdminUpdate.plan` Literal — stale plan names updated to current schema

- Bug fix: `GET /candidates` limit cap raised from 100 → 500; Kanban board's `limit=200` request was returning 422 (`backend/app/routers/candidates.py`)
- Bug fix: Removed "Add candidate" buttons from all Kanban pipeline columns (`frontend/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/page.tsx`)

- Dashboard Kanban candidate pipeline board — live data from `candidatesApi.list()`, 5 stage columns, job filter, card links to candidate profile (`frontend/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/page.tsx`)
- Created `mockup.html` — static self-contained dashboard UI mockup for design reference (project root)
