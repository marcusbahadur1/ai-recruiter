# PROGRESS — AI Recruiter (airecruiterz.com)
Last updated: 2026-04-14

## Summary

The backend is feature-complete. The frontend is ~90% complete — all core pages exist.
Three remaining Now items: embeddable widget JS snippet, SSE wiring on `/jobs/{id}`, and GDPR delete button on candidate profile.

## Session History

### Session 1 — Foundation
- Database models: tenant, job, candidate, application, chat_session, rag_document, job_audit_event, promo_code
- Pydantic v2 schemas for all models
- FastAPI app factory, config, database session, asyncpg driver
- Supabase JWT middleware + auth dependency
- Alembic migrations scaffolded

### Session 2 — AI Facade + Integration Services
- `ai_provider.py` facade routing to Claude or OpenAI based on tenant config
- `claude_ai.py`, `openai_ai.py` — full implementations
- `scrapingdog.py`, `brightdata.py` — SERP + LinkedIn profile enrichment
- `apollo.py`, `hunter.io`, `snov.py` — email discovery services
- `email_deduction.py` — SMTP-verified domain deduction fallback
- `embeddings.py` — pgvector embedding generation
- 63 unit tests

### Session 3 — Core Routers
- `auth.py` — signup, login
- `tenants.py` — GET/PATCH /tenants/me
- `jobs.py` — full CRUD + trigger-scout + SSE evaluation report
- `candidates.py` — search/filter, profile, GDPR delete, send-outreach
- `applications.py` — list, detail, trigger-test, public test endpoints, invite-interview action

### Session 4 — Audit Trail + GDPR + Remaining Routers
- `audit.py` — SSE audit stream (asyncpg LISTEN/NOTIFY), paginated history, super admin view
- `audit_trail.py` service — append-only events, GDPR PII redaction in-place
- `gdpr.py` service — erasure, data export, retention flagging
- `gdpr_settings.py`, `team.py`, `search.py`, `dashboard.py`, `screener.py` routers
- 55 new tests (118 total)

### Session 5 — Celery + Talent Scout Pipeline
- `celery_app.py` — Redis broker, beat scheduler
- `talent_scout.py` service — full 5-step pipeline logic
- `talent_scout_tasks.py` — Celery chord: discover → enrich → score → email (parallel, 5 concurrency limit)
- `scheduled_tasks.py` — beat tasks: `poll_mailboxes`, `send_daily_summaries`, `cleanup_expired_tokens`, `sync_stripe_plans`, `rag_refresh`
- 51 new tests (169 total)

### Session 6 — Resume Screener + Chat Sessions
- `screener_tasks.py` — 4 Celery tasks: `poll_mailboxes` (IMAP, runs in thread executor), `screen_resume`, `invite_to_test`, `score_test`
- `applications.py` updated — AI examiner (Claude) for competency test chat, probing follow-ups, triggers `score_test.delay()` on completion
- `chat_sessions.py` — full implementation: GET /current, POST /new, POST /{id}/message
  - Phase-aware prompts: job_collection (16-step JSON) → payment → recruitment (plain text)
  - Phase transitions driven by JSON responses from AI, not prompt instructions
- 36 new tests (205 total)

### Session 7 — Billing, RAG, Widget, Email Templates, Super Admin
- `webhooks.py` — Stripe (4 events: checkout, invoice paid/failed, subscription deleted) + email HMAC webhook
- `promo_codes.py` — full CRUD + public validate endpoint
- `rag.py` — scrape, upload (PDF/DOCX/TXT), delete; plan-gated (agency_small+)
- `widget.py` — public POST /widget/{slug}/chat, rate-limited, RAG-backed
- `super_admin.py` — tenant list/patch, impersonation (logged), platform keys, health, audit view
- `billing.py` — Stripe Customer Portal + plan management
- `rag_pipeline.py` service — crawl4ai→httpx fallback scraper, chunking (500 tokens), pgvector cosine query
- `crypto.py` — Fernet encryption for tenant API keys
- 12 Jinja2 email templates (all per spec)
- 43 new tests (242 total)

### Session 8 — Frontend Pages + Bug Fixes
- Built `/billing` — plan card, credits bar, Stripe portal/subscribe CTA, plan comparison grid
- Built `/settings/knowledge-base` — stats, scrape history timeline, chunk preview, re-scrape (deduped), re-scrape all, drag-and-drop upload, URL scraper, plan guard
- Built `/settings/ai-recruiter` — plain-English system prompt editor, save + reset to default, "Custom prompt active" badge
- `recruiter_system_prompt` TEXT column added to `tenants` model + `TenantUpdate` + `TenantResponse` schemas
- `chat_sessions.py` uses tenant's custom prompt for job_collection phase when set; falls back to hardcoded default
- Alembic migration `0011` — `recruiter_system_prompt TEXT NULL` on tenants (applied)
- Removed duplicate "AI Recruiter Prompt" tab from `/settings` page (now lives only at sub-page)
- Added sidebar nav entries: Billing, Knowledge Base, AI Recruiter Prompt
- Added staging smoke test suite: 8 Playwright specs + `staging-smoke.yml` GitHub Actions workflow
- Bug fix: `rag_pipeline._store_chunk` — `async with db.begin()` created savepoint inside autobegun transaction; outer transaction never committed so all scraped chunks were silently discarded. Fixed with explicit `db.flush() + db.commit()`
- Bug fix: `rag_pipeline._crawl` — `crawl4ai` could hang indefinitely when Playwright can't launch a browser (WSL2); added `asyncio.wait_for(..., timeout=30.0)` so it falls back to httpx+BeautifulSoup after 30 s
- Bug fix: `rag.py` plan gate used wrong plan names (`small_firm`, `mid_firm`) — corrected to `agency_small`, `agency_medium`
- Bug fix: dashboard layout `<main>` had `overflow:hidden` — page content below viewport was inaccessible; changed to `overflowY:auto`

## Known Issues

- `test_super_admin_audit_requires_super_admin_role` in `tests/integration/test_audit.py` makes a real Supabase HTTP call and fails in CI without live DB — pre-existing, not introduced in session 7.
- `resume_screener.py` is not a standalone service file (screener logic lives in `screener_tasks.py` directly) — diverges slightly from SPEC §19 file list but is functionally equivalent.
- DE/ES/FR translations for billing and widget config UI strings added in session 7–8 have not been verified for completeness.
