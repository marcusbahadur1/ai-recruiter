## Known Issues

- `test_super_admin_audit_requires_super_admin_role` in `tests/integration/test_audit.py` makes a real Supabase HTTP call and fails in CI without live DB — pre-existing, not introduced in session 7.
- `resume_screener.py` is not a standalone service file (screener logic lives in `screener_tasks.py` directly) — diverges slightly from SPEC §19 file list but is functionally equivalent.
